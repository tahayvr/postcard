Make a screenshot worth posting. Postcard is an [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org)
shell plugin: grab a region and it adds padding, a background,
rounded corners and a shadow, lets you annotate, and hides anything in
the picture that should not be public.

![Postcard editor](assets/showcase/screenshot-full.jpg)

## Features

**Framing**

- Padding, aspect ratio presets, corner radius, crop, shadow and an optional title bar
- Inset, which extends the screenshot's own edge color outwards to give a
  cramped window room to breathe
- Several shots on one card, side by side or stacked, each in a card of its
  own. Larger ones are scaled down to line up, or keep their sizes; each can
  be cropped, reordered or removed, and an arrow can point from one to another

![Framing](assets/showcase/framing.png)

**Backgrounds**

- Auto from the screenshot, gradients, flat colors, your Omarchy theme, your wallpaper,
  or none for a transparent PNG
- Your own colors and gradients: a picker with a screen eyedropper, and saved
  gradients of two to four colors at any angle, kept across restarts

![Backgrounds](assets/showcase/backgrounds.png)

**Annotation**

- Arrows, boxes, ellipses, highlighter, text labels and numbered steps
- Spotlight a rectangle or an ellipse and the rest of the screenshot dims,
  leaving the background as it is
- Magnify: drag over a detail and a zoomed lens (2×, 3× or 4×) appears beside it,
  joined by a line; move the lens and the magnified spot separately
- Drag to move, and they stay pinned to the screenshot when you reframe

![Annotations](assets/showcase/annotations.png)

**Hide sensitive data**

- One click pixelates emails, API keys, JWTs, AWS and GitHub tokens, card
  numbers, IBANs, IP addresses and phone numbers, each category switchable
- Card numbers are Luhn-checked; dates, versions, hashes and loopback
  addresses are left alone
- Pixelation is destructive, not a blur that can be undone
- Or copy the screenshot's text to the clipboard

**Code cards**

- Any selected text becomes a syntax-highlighted card in the same frame
- Language detected or chosen, font size, line numbers
- Every Omarchy theme you have installed, plus Dracula, Monokai, One Dark,
  GitHub and Solarized

![Postcard code card preview](assets/showcase/screenshot-full-code.jpg)

**Presets**

- Save the whole look (background, framing, corners, shadow, export settings and
  code card style) as a named preset and switch between them from the top of the
  panel; annotations are never part of one
- The preset you pick stays in use after a restart, so it is where every capture
  starts
- Kept in `~/.config/postcard/presets.json`

**Output**

- Clipboard or disk, PNG or JPEG, at 1x, 2x or 3x
- The preview is the file

## Install

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/tahayvr/postcard.git --enable
```

Update it with `omarchy plugin update tahayvr.postcard`

Remove it with `omarchy plugin remove tahayvr.postcard`,

or `omarchy plugin disable tahayvr.postcard` to keep it installed but off.

Plugins run as unsandboxed code inside your shell process. Read the source
before you enable it.

## Usage

Enabling the plugin puts a Postcard button 󰆟 in the bar. Left-click it to grab a
region or window, middle-click to make a code card from the selected text, right-click
for a menu: region, window, screen with an optional delay, code card, or the editor. Move it with:

```sh
omarchy bar move tahayvr.postcard --section center
```

Or bind keys in `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua`:

```lua
o.bind("SUPER + SHIFT + PRINT", "Postcard", "omarchy-shell shell summon tahayvr.postcard '{\"capture\":\"region\"}'")
o.bind("SUPER + SHIFT + C", "Postcard code card", "omarchy-shell shell summon tahayvr.postcard '{\"code\":true}'")
o.bind("SUPER + SHIFT + S", "Postcard editor", "omarchy-shell shell toggle tahayvr.postcard '{}'")
```

The buttons at the top of the editor grab a region, window or screen, make a
code card, or open a file. A code card takes the primary selection, or the
clipboard if nothing is highlighted.

### Recording

Right-click the Postcard bar button and choose **Record region** or **Record
screen**. Region lets you select an area (or a window's current rectangle);
screen records the focused monitor. A three-second countdown follows the
selection. The editor closes while recording. The bar shows a stop button
and elapsed time: click it to stop or cancel the countdown. Press Esc to
cancel the region picker.

Recordings are silent, 30 fps H.264 MP4 files, saved directly to
`$OMARCHY_SCREENRECORD_DIR`, else your XDG Videos directory, else `~/Videos`.
A notification confirms the saved path. Video styling, playback in the editor,
and audio are not included; screenshot framing and annotations do not apply
to recordings. A selected window's rectangle stays fixed if the window moves.

Postcard stops only its own recorder. Closing the editor does not stop a
recording; use the bar or `stopRecording`. Shell shutdown or plugin unload
closes the control pipe and asks the recorder to finish saving. Nonempty partial
files are kept if recording fails, with their path in the error message.

```sh
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard record region
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard record fullscreen
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard stopRecording ''
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard info ''
```

Start one recording at a time. Calls answer immediately; wait for `recording`
to become false in `info`, then check `recordingState` (`saved`, `cancelled`, or
`error`), `lastRecording` (last successful path), and `recordingError`.

### Scripting

Everything the editor does can be driven from the command line. `help` prints
the full reference, generated from the same lists the plugin uses, so it is
always current:

```sh
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard help ''         # every call
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard help set        # every setting and what it takes
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard help annotate   # every kind of mark and its fields
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard help capture
```

Three rules of the command line:

- Every call takes exactly one argument. One that needs nothing takes `''`.
- The argument is split on spaces, so a string inside JSON writes a space as
  `\u0020`: `'{"watermarkText":"by\u0020me"}'`. A path with a space in it
  cannot be passed at all.
- An argument that starts with `[` is split on commas, so a list goes inside an
  object: `annotate '{"items":[...]}'`.

A call answers `ok`, or a short reason such as `busy`, `no shot` or `bad json`.

#### Reference

```sh
# Getting a picture in
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard capture region        # region | windows | fullscreen | smart
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard capture '{"mode":"fullscreen","delay":5}'   # after 0–60 seconds
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard edit ~/Pictures/Screenshots/shot.png
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard add region            # another shot beside it: a mode, a path, or file
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard code ''               # code card from the selection (or pass the text)
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard pick ''               # system file picker
omarchy-shell shell hide tahayvr.postcard                       # close, or cancel a pending capture

# Styling
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard set '{"codeTheme":"nord","padding":8,"frame":"titlebar"}'
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard preset social-post    # "Social Post": a dash for each space; or default

# Marking up
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard annotate '{"kind":"box","x":40,"y":40,"w":300,"h":120}'
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard crop '{"x":80,"y":40,"w":900,"h":600}'   # the shot under it; or '' for the selection
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard uncrop ''             # back to the whole picture
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard redact ''             # find and hide secrets

# Getting it out
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard save ''               # to the screenshot folder (and the clipboard)
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard saveAs ''             # choose the file
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard copy ''               # to the clipboard
omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard copyText ''           # the text in the shot, by OCR

omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard info ''               # the document as JSON
```

A save never writes over an earlier one: two in the same second get `-2`,
`-3` and so on.

#### Waiting for the editor

Captures, OCR and exports run in the background and answer `ok` straight away,
so a script that chains calls has to wait between them. `info` says when the
editor is done: `hasContent` once a picture is in, and `capturing`, `busy`
(rendering, cropping, reading text) and `delivering` (writing the file)
while work is under way. After a save, `lastSaved` is the path it wrote.

These two functions, which need `jq` (it ships with Omarchy), are all the
recipes below rely on:

```sh
pc() { omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard "$@"; }

# Wait until Postcard holds a picture and has nothing left running.
pc_ready() {
  for _ in $(seq 150); do
    pc info '' | jq -e '.hasContent and ((.capturing or .busy or .delivering) | not)' >/dev/null && return 0
    sleep 0.2
  done
  return 1
}
```

The editor has to be open for anything to render, which every call that brings
a picture in does by itself. Close it at the end with
`omarchy-shell shell hide tahayvr.postcard`.

#### Recipes

**One key: grab a region, style it, save it, print the path.** Save as
`~/.local/bin/postcard-shot`, make it executable, and bind it like any command.
The check on `shotPath` tells a cancelled pick apart from the picture that was
already open:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
pc() { omarchy-shell shell call tahayvr.postcard "$@"; }
pc_ready() { for _ in $(seq 150); do pc info '' | jq -e '.hasContent and ((.capturing or .busy or .delivering) | not)' >/dev/null && return 0; sleep 0.2; done; return 1; }

before=$(pc info '' | jq -r .shotPath)
pc capture region >/dev/null && pc_ready || exit 1
[ "$(pc info '' | jq -r .shotPath)" = "$before" ] && exit 1   # cancelled
pc preset social >/dev/null
pc save '' >/dev/null && pc_ready && pc info '' | jq -r .lastSaved
omarchy-shell shell hide tahayvr.postcard
```

```lua
o.bind("PRINT", "Postcard shot", "postcard-shot")
```

**A folder of screenshots in one look.** Every picture gets the same preset
and is saved beside the others:

```sh
pc preset docs
for f in ~/Pictures/raw/*.png; do
  pc edit "$f" >/dev/null && pc_ready && pc save '' >/dev/null && pc_ready &&
    pc info '' | jq -r .lastSaved
done
omarchy-shell shell hide tahayvr.postcard
```

**A marked-up screenshot for documentation.** The whole screen without a
picker, cropped to the part that matters, with an arrow and a label.
Coordinates are in the picture's own pixels:

```sh
pc capture fullscreen >/dev/null && pc_ready
pc crop '{"x":0,"y":0,"w":1600,"h":1000}' >/dev/null && pc_ready
pc annotate '{"items":[{"kind":"arrow","x":200,"y":200,"w":300,"h":150},{"kind":"text","x":520,"y":360,"text":"Click\u0020here","size":40}]}'
pc save '' >/dev/null && pc_ready
```

**Before and after, side by side.** Two regions, one card each, lined up
and saved. `layoutDir` `column` stacks them instead:

```sh
pc capture region >/dev/null && pc_ready
pc add region >/dev/null && pc_ready
pc set '{"layoutDir":"row","slotGap":6}' >/dev/null && pc_ready
pc save '' >/dev/null && pc_ready && pc info '' | jq -r .lastSaved
```

With several shots, marks and crops are in the combined picture's pixels,
left to right (or top to bottom) with the gaps; `info` lists the shots.

**A code card from a file.** The text can not go on the command line, since
it would be split at every space, so it goes through the selection:

```sh
wl-copy --primary < src/main.rs
pc code '' >/dev/null && pc_ready
pc set '{"codeTheme":"nord","codeNumbers":true,"frame":"titlebar","frameTitle":"main.rs"}'
pc copy '' >/dev/null && pc_ready
```

**Hide anything secret, then copy it for a chat.**

```sh
pc edit ~/Pictures/Screenshots/terminal.png >/dev/null && pc_ready
pc redact '' >/dev/null && pc_ready
pc copy '' >/dev/null && pc_ready
omarchy-shell shell hide tahayvr.postcard
```

**Sign everything.** A watermark is part of the style, so it can be set once
and saved into a preset from the editor, or set for one picture:

```sh
pc set '{"watermarkText":"@you","watermarkSize":120}'
```

## Dependencies

All of these ship with Omarchy:

- `omarchy`
- `bat`
- `imagemagick`
- `tesseract`
- `wl-clipboard`
- `python-gobject`
- `xdg-desktop-portal`
- `gpu-screen-recorder`, `ffmpeg` (including `ffprobe`) and Python 3 for recording

Postcards are read from and saved to the directory Omarchy uses
(`$OMARCHY_SCREENSHOT_DIR`, else `$XDG_PICTURES_DIR`, else `~/Pictures`) as
`postcard-<date>_<time>.png`. OCR follows `$OMARCHY_OCR_LANGS`.
